## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Firebase orange (#FFA000) to match the Firebase branding.
- Background color: Dark gray (#303134) to give the modern look.
- Accent color: A lighter shade of blue (#89b4fa) to offer enough contrast over a dark background.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' for headlines and 'Inter' for body text. Space Grotesk is a sans-serif, and Inter is a grotesque-style sans-serif.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Subtle letter animations for user attention, especially on load.
- Responsive design that is optimized for use on current mobile devices.
